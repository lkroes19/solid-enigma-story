Chapter 1: (Jlee)
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemn. First... I want to thank you all for your
continual service; some of us may have lost our brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers,
friends... and for some of us, we may have lost parts of ourselves. It's hard. It's
painful, yes.. and I won't deny such. But brothers and sisters, when we bury their bodies,
when we lay them down to Mother Earth, their physical bodies are no longer present, but 
their spirits live among those who have decided to carry on their legacies. Us. We are the
resistance, we are humanity's last chance, and I'll be damned if I won't be able to give 
my fallen brothers and sisters a proper burial. So with that, I announce our great plan.." 

Chapter 2: (Ben Lang)
"Our great plan to overthrow the Aliens using a new chemical our scientists have discovered. It is known as Alpha 6.
This chemical was developed and tested thoroughly and is proven to immobilize the aliens. With such a chemical, we will finally have the upper hand against these disgusting parisites. With the enemy advancing quickly on the eastern front, we are looking for a few brave volenteers to go out and test our new weapons. Our new blasters use Alpha 6. Though we are certain this chemical will destroy the enemy, we are unsure exactly how to effectively use it on the aliens. If this blaster were to work, the aliens would have no chance of winning."
*All of a sudden an alien company floods the room firing their weapons on the crowd*
*Everyone scrambles and UPC #16 hides under the podium*
*He yells for assistance, but is confronted with an alien who spots him. . .*
