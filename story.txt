Chapter 1: (Jlee)
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemn. First... I want to thank you all for your
continual service; some of us may have lost our brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers,
friends... and for some of us, we may have lost parts of ourselves. It's hard. It's
painful, yes.. and I won't deny such. But brothers and sisters, when we bury their bodies,
when we lay them down to Mother Earth, their physical bodies are no longer present, but 
their spirits live among those who have decided to carry on their legacies. Us. We are the
resistance, we are humanity's last chance, and I'll be damned if I won't be able to give 
my fallen brothers and sisters a proper burial. So with that, I announce our great plan.."
